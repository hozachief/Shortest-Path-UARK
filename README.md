# Shortest-Path-UARK

Shortest Path UARK is a web application.

All files and folders aside from the "ClientApp" folder are part of the Application Programming Interface (API) backend. The API backend is implemented utilizing the ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.2).

To run the web application locally:
Open the project, using "shortest-path-UARK.csproj", in your preferred IDE. Visual Studio is a good option.
You must run the following command in the "ClientApp" directory.
$ npm start

You might need to install npm packages in the ClientApp subdirectory. Follow more detailed instructions for setting up your environment in the link below.
